    <h3>Biography </h3>
    <pre>
        My name full name is Bekbolsun Ibragimov.I am from the southern part of Kyrgyzstan,
        graduated from the Turkish men's lyceum named after Kurmanbek Baatyr, after which
        I entered the first year at Salymbekov University in the AIT
        (American Institute of Technology) faculty.If we talk about my achievements as
        a CS student, they are quite modest. For example, we wrote several
        programs in Python. But the largest and most significant programs were “Obmenka.ait”,
        “Shop.ait”, etc.

    <h3>Where I see myself in 5 y.</h3>
    <pre>
        I see myself in the future as a software engineer with good qualifications. Who will work
        in large tech companies and who will participate in the development of the newest and
        most useful inventions. And I understand that for this I have to learn something new every
        day, since in my field something relevant today may become unnecessary tomorrow.
